## About GraphQL Sample
<hr>
In this repo, I show you how you can use GraphQL on your project. This project has two directories. The server directory has just one file.

You first have to install the requirements and then you can run the server.

in the client directory, You can see an HTML file that uses a js file. in the js file, we send a request to the GraphQL server. you don't need to open this HTML file on a local server. you can call it directly.

In this project, I didn't use any kind of database. Instead of that, You just have two objects on the server.js file. The first object is the authors' list and the second one is the books list.

inside of code, you can find some comments that give you more info about the codes. You also can use the readme.txt file in the server directory to get more info about the project.

- Express [Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js](https://expressjs.com/).
- express-graphql [The simplest way to run a GraphQL API server is to use Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js. ](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/).

## Install
<hr>

### Install dependencies and run the server.
You just need to download the package, And then you have to use "npm install" command to install all necessary packages. Then you just need to open api directory by using [npm run devStart](). Now Node.js server is ready, Now you can see 'Server running at port 5000'.

###### To install the dependencies and start the app, run the following commands:
* >cd server
* >npm install
* >npm run devStart

### Install dependencies and run the frontend

You don`t need to do anything. You just need to call the index.html file from the client directory directly.
